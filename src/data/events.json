        "description": "<p>The Game and Watch series was a successful line of products from Nintendo that generated enough profit for the company to invest heavily in researching and developing the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Gameboy.</p><p>This ensured the company's survival and dominance through a competitive period of electronic game industry development, consumption and growth. These small hand-held games broke new ground in the application of electronics to toys. They have a monochrome LCD (liquid crystal display) screen on which the player can control the movement of characters through a themed set of tasks.</p><p>The balance between an achievable outcome and a degree of difficulty invited the user to play the game again and again, thus achieving one of the principal goals of electronic game design.</p>"

        "description": "<p>The Game Boy is the most popular game console in history (2003) selling in excess of 64 million units since its inception in 1989 through to 1998 when Nintendo began production of the Game Boy colour model. A major contribution to the success of the Game Boy was the decision to bundle the Tetris game with all purchases in the USA and other countries.</p><p>The Game Boy became a wearable accessory in a similar sense to the Sony \"Walkman\" - it was personalised and principally used exclusively by the owner in private and public spaces. The use of this type (wearable, electronic) of device in public spaces tends to isolate the users from their surroundings.</p><p>To many this practice is perceived as non-social behaviour. It is interesting to note recent studies of behaviour and etiquette in public spaces by users of these technologies including mobile phones, digital assistants and other wireless (WAP) devices that expose the general abhorrence yet tolerance of their use.</p>"
